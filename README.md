# Meteorite_Locations
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to map meteorite data. The Meteoritical Society collects data on known meteorite landings, including but not limited to:
- Class of Meteorite
- Weight (in grams)
- Year

As such, we have created a visualization in Tableau to present this information.

## Resources
  * Data Source: [NASA Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh)
  * Software: Tableau 22.2.1

## Results
Working with Tableau, we created a visualization representing the dataset. The map can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/MeteoriteLandings_16703066849720/Meteorites?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

The user can input a year range to see what meteorites were recorded. The user can also move the map around to go around the globe. The information provided for each data point is as follows:
- Name
- Class
- ID
- Mass (g)
- Year
